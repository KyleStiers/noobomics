Description: This package defines two functions, noobomics() and find_plot_range(). Find_plot_range() is a condensed usage of range() implemented here to force axes to the same limits for investigating correlations. Noobomics() takes in two data frames - d1, d2- nothing more. These two frames are designed to be matching, PRE-SORTED BY ID (in excel) sets of the format: ‘ID,Reference,Sample1,Sample2’ format csv files. It will take the two data frames, match IDs found in both automatically, create density histogram plots (for the user to assess distribution), all 6 combinations possible in scatterplots and report Pearson correlation (R), plot an unscaled heatmap of the data using default (distfun, hclustfun) parameters, and finally produce a biplot of the first two Principal Components with labels of significance (PC1 and PC2 abs(score) > 0.5) from IDs. It is important to use descriptive headers in the input files with no spaces or special characters, e.g. WT, rna_Mutant1,prot_Mutant1, etc. Plan on adding more input parameters to specify things like significance expressions defined by user, distance/clustering options, maybe colors, etc. in the future.
